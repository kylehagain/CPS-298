Hello, I am Kyle Hitte. I'm on my last semester of WCC working in the Comp Sci: Programming in Java Program. I've been working primarily with Java, and have little to no experience with many other major languages. Despite that, I'm interested in learning C++ as well as C#. PHP as well, but it's not so high on the list. Other than school, I work in the front of a grocery store in Saline, Michigan. Im passionate about geography and history, which ties into my hobby of videogames more often than not. In free time, I talk to friends and play games with them online.
